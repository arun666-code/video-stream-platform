# VStream

VStream is a minimal video streaming platform consisting of a Flask backend and a simple HTML/JS client.

- `server/` – Flask application that handles video uploads, stores metadata in a SQLite database, and streams videos to clients.
- `client/` – Web interface for uploading and viewing videos.

## Running

1. Follow the instructions in `server/README.md` to start the backend server.
2. Open `client/index.html` in your browser to use the client interface.
